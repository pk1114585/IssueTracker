## Database - MongoDB:
MongoDB is utilized as the database for storing project and issue data. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for applications with varying data structures. In the context of this issue-tracking application, MongoDB provides an efficient means to store project information, issue details, and labels associated with each project.
The application communicates with MongoDB through a Node.js library, such as Mongoose, which provides an elegant and intuitive way to define data schemas and interact with the database.
